### Project Overview

We propose the development of a highly interactive **gaming web application** featuring real-time chat rooms (text and voice), multiplayer games, and community-focused features. The web app will support 100 users per room, offer seamless gameplay for Billiards (five versions), Chess, and Ludo, and provide advanced social features like a mini-forum, leaderboards, and media sharing.

This proposal outlines the key components, technology stack, deliverables, cost breakdown, and information on ongoing operational costs for building and maintaining the platform.

   - **Cannon.js**: 3D physics engine for realistic ball behavior and collision detection in Billiards.
   - **React Spring**: Smooth animations for cue movements, transitions, and other game interactions.
   - **Redux**: For state management, tracking game progress, players' scores, and game sessions.
   - **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication for multiplayer interactions, including chat and game moves.
   - **Styled-components**: For styling the game interface, offering dynamic and themeable designs.
   
2. **Backend (Server-Side):**
   - **Nest.js**: A scalable backend framework that provides the API, handles authentication, and multiplayer game logic.
   - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for handling user data, game room information, chat history, and leaderboard stats.
   - **Redis**: For managing real-time data, caching, and sessions to ensure high performance and low latency during gameplay.
   - **Socket.IO**: Integrated into the backend for real-time messaging and game interactions.
   - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication and authorization.

3. **Game Development (Billiards, Chess, Ludo):**
   - **React-Three-Fiber**: For 3D rendering in Billiards, enabling high-quality graphics and animations.
   - **Cannon.js**: A powerful physics engine to simulate realistic ball movements, collisions, and interactions in Billiards.
   - **Custom Game Engine**: For Chess and Ludo, developed in JavaScript to manage game mechanics and rules.
   - **WebGL**: For optimizing performance and rendering graphics in real-time.

4. **Real-Time Communication:**
   - **WebRTC**: For real-time video and voice chat within game rooms.
   - **Socket.IO**: For instant messaging, move synchronization in multiplayer games, and room communication.

5. **Payment Integration:**
   - **Stripe**: For handling payments via Visa, Mastercard, and other card options.
   - **PayPal**: For an additional payment option.
   - **Apple Pay**: For seamless mobile payments.

6. **Media Sharing & CDN:**
   - **YouTube/TikTok/Instagram API**: For sharing and embedding media within the chat and game rooms.
   - **Cloudflare CDN**: For faster content delivery and to reduce server load.

7. **Security & Scalability:**
   - **AWS** or **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: For hosting, database management, and scaling the platform based on user demand.
   - **OAuth 2.0**: For secure user login and third-party integrations.
   - **SSL/TLS Encryption**: To ensure secure communication between users and the server.
   - **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: To protect against potential threats like DDoS attacks.

### Ongoing Operational Costs

In addition to the development costs, there will be **ongoing operational costs** to maintain and run the platform. These costs will be calculated based on actual usage and will include the following components:

1. **Server Hosting and Scaling**
   - **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**, **Google Cloud**, or **Azure** will be used to host the application.
   - Costs will vary depending on user activity, data storage, and required resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth).
   - **Pay-as-you-go** model: You will be billed based on server usage, which will scale up and down depending on the number of active users and games played.
   
2. **Database Management**
   - The application will use **MongoDB**, which has a pricing model based on storage capacity, number of requests, and performance needs.
   - Ongoing costs will be linked to data volume and database operations.
   
3. **Real-Time Communication Costs (WebSockets & Voice)**
   - **WebSockets** for real-time messaging will incur costs based on the volume of concurrent connections and data transferred.
   - **Voice communication** through **WebRTC** will also have costs associated with bandwidth and media server usage.
   - These will follow a **usage-based billing** structure.
   
4. **Media Handling & CDN Costs**
   - The use of **CDN (Cloudflare)** for distributing game assets, videos (TikTok, YouTube), and images will have costs based on the amount of data transferred.
   - **Media processing** for shared videos (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube) will also incur costs depending on how much data is processed and streamed.
   
5. **Payment Gateway Fees**
   - Payment providers like **Stripe** and **PayPal** charge transaction fees for every payment processed. These will be deducted based on actual payment volumes.
   
6. **Maintenance and Support**
   - Ongoing software updates, security patches, and technical support will be provided on a retainer basis, ensuring the app remains functional and secure.
   - Maintenance can be billed on a **monthly or quarterly basis** as agreed upon.
